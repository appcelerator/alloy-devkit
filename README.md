# Alloy DevKit

> Tooling monorepo for [Alloy](https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy)

This repo contains the Alloy [compiler](packages/alloy-compiler/README.md) and [utility](packages/alloy-utils/README.md) libraries.

It is a mirror and refactor of the contents from Alloy's [compile](https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy/tree/master/Alloy/commands/compile) command.

Based on [Alloy v1.14.5](https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy/tree/1.14.5).
